## Your Project:  US Police Shootings

### Context
In the recent killings, a hot topic came into being, `Racism`.

This dataset gather some data to take out some insights and analyze the story around racism in America. We have downloaded this dataset from Kaggle and you are free to use it for visualization  and finding some insights. Imagine that I am a client and you own a data science and analytics start-up. I came to you that I am having this dataset and I am working on a documentry, where I am planning to present a few facts about US Police Shootings such as if there is an evident history of racial bias towards the any community such as Black/Asian/etc. 

### Content
It contains basic data about people such as their name, age, gender and race. Along with it, is the shooting/killing information, such as date of event, where it happened? how they were shot? did they attack? Were they holding weapons? Did they show any mental illness? Was the policeman wearing a camera/was the incident recorded? Did the suspect flee? Apart from that, a category column holds type of weapon used by the suspect


## Questions to be answered:

1. Please find the Racial Distribution Of Police Shooting Victims?
2. What is Gender distribution of the victims?
3. Can we get some insights on their age?
4. Plot a graph on Number of police shootings over the years 2015-2020
5. What is the ratio of manner of death?
6. What is racial distribution of victims who were Shot and Tasered
7. What are the most common weapons present with the victims?
8. Can you find City wise distributions of Police Killings?
