## Your Project:  US Police Shootings

### Context
In the recent killings, a hot topic came into being, `Racism`.

This dataset gather some data to take out some insights and analyze the story around racism in America. We have downloaded this dataset from Kaggle and you are free to use it for visualization  and finding some insights. Imagine that I am a client and you own a data science and analytics start-up. I came to you that I am having this dataset and I am working on a documentry, where I am planning to present a few facts about US Police Shootings such as if there is an evident history of racial bias towards the any community such as Black/Asian/etc. 

### Content
It contains basic data about people such as their name, age, gender and race. Along with it, is the shooting/killing information, such as date of event, where it happened? how they were shot? did they attack? Were they holding weapons? Did they show any mental illness? Was the policeman wearing a camera/was the incident recorded? Did the suspect flee? Apart from that, a category column holds type of weapon used by the suspect


## Questions to be answered:

Please present the following visualisation along with insights you gained by analysing the dataset. Please use new slides for each question and in total there should be a minimum of 10 slides. 

1. Please plot Deaths by Shooting (Date). 
2. Please plot US Police Shootings Deaths by age. 
3. Visulaise the number of death in each state and by race. `Hint`: Please plot one bar chart and one pie chart. 
4. Please plot US Police Shootings Deaths by Manner of Death
5. Please plot US Police Shootings by Cities
6. Plot plot US Police Shootings Deaths by Gun type
